Chemistry/File/MDLMol version 0.15
Chemistry/File/SDF    version 0.15
==================================

This modules read MDL mol and sd files. Please note that they are at an early
stage of development and implement only a tiny fraction of the standard.
However, it is a the tiny fraction that the author finds useful for a great
fraction of everyday use, so it's not entirely useless.

Chemistry::File::MDLMol reads and writes only the basic connection table; that
is, the coordinates and symbol of each atom, and the type and atoms of each
bond.  Chemistry::File::SDF does the same, returning a list of molecules. It
also reads the data items for each molecule.

The MDLmol module automatically registers the 'mdl' format with Chemistry::Mol,
so that PDB files may be identified and read by Chemistry::Mol::read_mol().
The SDF module registers the 'sdf' format.

CHANGES SINCE VERSION 0.10
        - Added write_string method to MDLMol.pm and SDF.pm
        - Changed SDF data storage attribute to a hash ref in 'sdf/data'
          instead of storing each attribute individually. WARNING: incompatible
          change.
