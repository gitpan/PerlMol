Chemistry/File/MDLMol version 0.17
Chemistry/File/SDF    version 0.17
==================================

This modules read MDL mol and sd files. Please note that they are at an early
stage of development and implement only a fraction of the standard.  However,
it is a fraction that the author finds useful for most everyday needs.

Chemistry::File::MDLMol reads and writes only the basic connection table; that
is, the coordinates and symbol of each atom, and the type and atoms of each
bond. Chemistry::File::SDF does the same, returning a list of molecules. It
also reads the data items for each molecule.

The MDLmol module automatically registers the 'mdl' format with Chemistry::Mol,
so that PDB files may be identified and read by Chemistry::Mol::read_mol().
The SDF module registers the 'sdf' format.

CHANGES SINCE VERSION 0.16
        - Fixed name_is in MDLMol, which was using .sdf instead of .mol as the
          extension.
