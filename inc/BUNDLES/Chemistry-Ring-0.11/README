Chemistry::Ring version 0.11
============================

The Chemistry::Ring module provides some basic methods for representing a ring.
A ring is a subclass of molecule, because it has atoms and bonds. Besides that,
it has some useful geometric methods for finding the centroid and the ring
plane, and methods for aromaticity detection.

The Chemistry::Ring::Find module implements a simple breadth-first ring finding
algorithm. It does not find all the rings in the structure; it only finds the
rings that include a starting atom or bond. Future versions may find all the
rings in the molecule, or perhaps the Smallest Set of Smallest Rings.

This module is part of the PerlMol project, L<http://www.perlmol.org/>.
