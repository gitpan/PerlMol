Chemistry/File/MDLMol version 0.20
Chemistry/File/SDF    version 0.20
==================================

This modules read MDL mol and SDF (structure data file) files. 

The MDLmol module automatically registers the 'mdl' format with Chemistry::Mol,
so that molfiles may be identified and read by Chemistry::Mol::read_mol().
The SDF module registers the 'sdf' format.

CHANGES SINCE VERSION 0.19
        - Added support for charges and radicals.
        - Add implicit hydrogens on read.
        - Support for some query properties: atom lists, bond topology, and
          bond types.
